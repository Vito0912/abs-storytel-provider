## Installation

### Using Docker (recommended)

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:** Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your desired directory with the following content:

    ```yaml
    version: "3.8"
    services:
      storytel-provider:
        image: ghcr.io/vito0912/storytel-provider:latest
        container_name: storytel-provider
        restart: unless-stopped
        networks:
          - abs_network
        security_opt:
          - no-new-privileges:true

    networks:
      abs_network:
        external: true
    ```

2. **Run Docker Compose:**
